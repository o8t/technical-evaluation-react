### `packages used`

In this project I used the bootstrap, sass and sweetalert packages.

1). Bootstrap was used to design the frontend of our app. (This package provides many built in classes in order 
to make the design so that's why i used this library. Writing custom styling from scratch is not feasible. 
It provides a lot of responsive built-in classes.)

2). SASS is used to do styling of our app. (This package is used to use some custom styling. SASS is used to describe 
the style of a document cleanly and structurally, with more power than flat CSS allows. Sass both provides a simpler, 
more elegant syntax for CSS and implements various features that are useful for creating manageable stylesheets.)


3). Sweetalert is used to show the alert whenever user don't upload his profile image.(SweetAlert CDN Library: The sweetAlert is a 
replacement for JavaScript's window. alert() function that shows very pretty modal windows. It's a standalone 
library that has no dependencies, and it's made from a JavaScript file plus a CSS file. Sweet Alert is used to make an alert
box more attractive and easier to design.)

4). Typescript is also used in this app.
